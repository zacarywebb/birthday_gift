    `I want you to know this: these letters are for you—each one a small, inadequate attempt to express emotions words could never truly capture.\nYou have changed me in so many quiet, beautiful ways. Being with you reminds me that love doesn’t always have to be loud to be powerful—it can be soft and steady and consistent and still shake the foundation of a life.\n\nThese letters are a small attempt to illustrate and put into words what your presence in my life has meant to me. Each song displayed before you echoes my perspective of your soul. They are pieces of you..pieces of our connection, scattered amongst melodies .\nOn days we’re together and even more on the days we’re apart, I hope you’ll read them and listen, and remember that I am with you. That I believe in you. That no matter where life takes us, I carry your heart with me, always.\n\nWith all my love,\nZac`,    
    "To meet you was not to experience some flash of love at first sight, but something different...something softer and far more certain. To meet and truly begin to know you felt like remembering rather than discovering, as if our souls had known each other long before they allowed our physical selves to meet—as though my soul had been quietly waiting for yours, desperately awaiting your arrival. You entered my life not as a surprise, but as a truth I had always known—it was always going to be you.",
    "Without you, life loses its color. To experience life in the absence of your presence is to ache and to suffer—wishing only that I had someone to share it all with.",
    "How endlessly lucky am I to witness the way you turn even life’s quietest moments into memories I’ll hold forever? What a gift it is to sleep in beside you on a still Sunday morning, or to wander aimlessly about on a golden spring evening, your hand placed gently within mine. Since loving you, no longer does the notion of ordinary exist in my life.",
    "In your absence, I carry within me, embedded deep within the depths of my soul, your love, like sunlight in my chest. It warms me when we are apart and brings me peace in difficult times—it is a light that extends beyond even my own self, but to all those I interact with.",
    "Know this, always: my love for you is constant, quiet as breath, and enduring as time. I am with you—through joy and stillness, through sorrow and storm. I see within you such a tremendous passion for others and such a strength to preserve through life’s many trials. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you know, and I will walk beside you, hand in hand, through every season of your life.",
    "I’ve seen you go through more in the past few years than most people face in a lifetime, and I’ve seen you grow stronger because of it. There’s something so special about the way you carry both resilience and kindness, how you still laugh freely and care so deeply. I will forever be immeasurably drawn to you—in this life and any other, you’ll always feel like home to me."
